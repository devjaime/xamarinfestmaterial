Requirements</h2><p>Internet connection is required in order to setup and run the demos.</p><p>Demo 3.4 setup.</p><h2 id="setup">Setup</h2><p>Make sure to complete the setup steps for Demo 3.4. That includes queuing and completing a successful build on VSTS. If you setup a Test Cloud account you will also have some test results to show. Hopefully you will be able to show another successful build during the session (kicked off at the start of Demo 3.4 and continuing while you get through Demo 3.5) completing before you get to this demo. If the build has not completed, you can fall back to the one you did at the end of the Demo 3.4 setup.</p><h2 id="demo-steps">Demo Steps</h2><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li><p>Login back into the VSTS portal and click on the Build &amp; Release (1) link. Show build complete with success (2).</p></li></ol><blockquote><p><img src="./media/image1.png" width="445" height="331" /></p></blockquote><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li><p>If you setup a Test Cloud account in demo 3.4. Login back into the Xamarin Test Cloud portal. If we drill down into our team project for the GPSImageTag.Droid. We can see the results from deploying our tests to Xamarin Test Cloud from our VSTS build.</p></li></ol><blockquote><p><img src="./media/image2.png" width="670" height="256" /></p></blockquote><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li><p>Logging back into the HockeyApp portal.

The provides a thorough DevOps cycle.</p></li></ol>
